# What columns are needed?

Task 4 - Halloween Candy Data

Back to [main analysis](task4_analysis_halloween_candy.html).

We have three spreadsheet files, one for each year 2015, 2016 and 2017. 
This document is for the purpose of trying to figure out which columns are 
necessary to answer the analysis questions.

## Analysis questions:

### Q1
1. What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. 
(Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)

#### 2015 Candy columns:

 * [4] `"[Butterfinger]"` ... [96] `"[York Peppermint Patties]"`
 * [114] `"[Sea-salt flavored stuff, probably chocolate, since this is the \"it\" flavor of the year]"` .. [115] `"[Necco Wafers]"`                                                              
 
 Questionable non-edilble/candy? Just leave as is. e.g.
 
* [18] `"[Cash, or other forms of legal tender]"`
* [23] `"[Dental paraphenalia]"`
* [26] `"[Generic Brand Acetaminophen]"`                                          
* [27] `"[Glow sticks]"`         
* [28] `"[Broken glow stick]"`  
...etc there are plenty more
 
 These two columns do contain some candy mentions but a lot of non-candy items.
 Wont' use yet - some dodgy stuff like sexual references.
 
 * [98] `"Please list any items not included above that give you JOY."`
 * [99] `"Please list any items not included above that give you DESPAIR."`
 
#### 2016 Candy columns:

* [7] `"[100 Grand Bar]"` ... [106] `"[York Peppermint Patties]"`  

The following column is full of NA values and has the word Ignore in title...
...so we will ignore it.

* `"[York Peppermint Patties] Ignore"`

Similar to 2015 These two columns do contain some candy mentions but a lot of 
non-candy items. Wont' use.

* [107] `"Please list any items not included above that give you JOY."`
* [108] `"Please list any items not included above that give you DESPAIR." `

#### 2017 Candy columns:

* [7] `"Q6 | 100 Grand Bar"` .. [109] `"Q6 | York Peppermint Patties"`

Task 4 - Halloween Candy Data

We have three spreadsheet files. for 2015, 2016 qnd 2017. This document is to 
try and figure out which columns are necessary to answer the analysis questions.

## Analysis questions:

### Q1
1. What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. 
(Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Don’t count missing values)

#### 2015 Candy columns:

 * [4] "[Butterfinger]" ... [96] "[York Peppermint Patties]"
 * [114] "[Sea-salt flavored stuff, probably chocolate, since this is the \"it\" flavor of the year]" .. [115] "[Necco Wafers]"                                                              
 
 Questionable non-edilble/candy?
 
 * [18] "[Cash, or other forms of legal tender]"
 * [23] "[Dental paraphenalia]"

 These two columns do contain some candy mentions but a lot of non-candy items
 
 * [98] "Please list any items not included above that give you JOY." 
 * [99] "Please list any items not included above that give you DESPAIR." 
 
#### 2016 Candy columns:

* [7] "[100 Grand Bar]" ... [106] "[York Peppermint Patties]"  

The following column is full of NA values and has the word Ignore in title...
...so we will ignore it.
* "[York Peppermint Patties] Ignore"

 These two columns do contain some candy mentions but a lot of non-candy items
 
* [107] "Please list any items not included above that give you JOY."
* [108] "Please list any items not included above that give you DESPAIR."
